USAGE and COOKBOOK
------------------

1. TO RUN

  type ./SynoTerm



LOADING A YaTeA XML TERM LIST

  Menu "Data Loading"

    then "XML Corpus (YaTeA)"

    select a XML file ( output of Yatea)

     then if you want to carry out a free indexing, or if it is the
          corpus for controlled indexing, select "Corpus"

	  if you want to carry out a controlled indexing, and that it
	  is the controlled term list, select "term list"
 

LOADDING A RELATION DICTIONARY
  
  Menu "Data Loading"

  then "Relation directory"

  select a relatio dictionary (extension .syn), for instance WordNet.syn

    then OK (Poor typography means that words are in capital,
             iso-8859-1 mmeans that dictionary first have to be translated in
             HTML entities)

RELATION ACQUISITION

  FREE INDEXING

    Menu "Relation acquisition"
 
    then "Free indexing"

      you can chose your dictionary and your corpus, if you have
      loaded several.

      you can chose the name of a temporary file (New file) to store
      results during the process.

     then type OK 

         (the acquisition process is generally very fast - few seconds)

     the save the inferred relations :

      Menu "Relation acquisition"

      then "Save inferred relations"

  CONTROLLED INDEXING

    Menu "Relation acquisition"

    then "Controlled indexing"

      you can chose your dictionary, your term list, and your corpus,
      if you have loaded several.

      you can chose the name of a temporary file (New file) to store
      results during the process.

     then type OK 

         (the acquisition process is generally very fast - few seconds)

     the save the inferred relations :

      Menu "Relation acquisition"

      then "Save inferred relations"

OUTPUTING INFERRED RELATIONS

 This can be done before, during or after the validation process.


  Menu "Output"

          'Families' : print the relations in a file with the
                       extension ".families", according to the family
                       view

	  'Classes' : print the relations in a file with the extension
	              ".classes", according to the class view

	  'Relation list' : print the relations in a raw file. Each
	              line contains a relation with related informatin
	              (rule for the inference, relationship, and
	              validation). Each term is lemmatized.

	  'Relation list (inlfected forms)' : print the relations in a
	                  raw file. Each line contains a relation with
	                  related informatin (rule for the inference,
	                  relationship, and validation). Each term is
	                  inflected.

	  'Terminae (not XML)' : specific output for Terminae, it seems  not be used yet

	  'XML' : print the relations in a XML file (SynoTerm.dtd) and can be used in Terminae



LOADING RESULTS FOR VALIDATION

  Menu Data Loading

    then "Inferred relation" 

       Select the file with the extension ".res.db"


VALIDATION PROCESS

  In the menu validation, you have two views : family and class

  Family view shows the results according to the initial relation used
  to infer synonnymy relation between terms

  Class view shows results gathered as connected components

  Interface has very similar functionnnalities for both views 

    First line of buttons help to navigate between the
    classes/families

    Second line contains two buttons to "save validation and display
    the next classes/families", or "reject all the relations and
    display the next classes/families" (with the latter button, you
    don't need to reject each relation).

    The last part displays relations.

          the left part is used to indicate if the relation is valid
          (Y), not valid (N), or that it's impossible to make a
          decision (?).

          The right part could be useful to modifu the type of the
          relation. But here, it is not useful.


VALIDATION RECORDING

      Menu "Relation acquisition"

      then "Save inferred relations"

GENERATING A WORDNET RELATION DICTIONAY

 if you don't have WordNet.syn file, you can generate it with
 Synoterm, from the WordNet distribution :

  Menu Data Loading

   then "Generate relation dictionary from WordNet

      Select the Wordnet directory (SynoTerm checks that is contains
      the sub directory "dict", and the files "data.adj", "data.adv",
      "data.noun" and "data.verb"

   The WordNet relation dictionary is generated in the current
   directory (generally where you run SynoTerm)


 WordNet distribution is available here :

   http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~ wn/

TROUBLESHOOTING

  Usual problem when runing SynoTerm is the lack of '.' in the
  PATH. You can add this a the run time, in your shell, like this :

          PATH=.:$PATH
